# Power-Consumption-Prediction-Dataset

Load Forecasting for Electrical Consumption
Overview
This project focuses on forecasting electrical load demand using time series data and advanced machine learning techniques. Accurate load forecasting is essential for efficient energy management, optimizing resources, and preventing outages in the energy sector.

Key Objectives
Analyze historical energy consumption data.
Develop predictive models to forecast future electrical load demand.
Improve forecasting accuracy using feature engineering and machine learning algorithms.
Features
Data Analysis and Visualization: Explore patterns, trends, and seasonality in the time series data.
Machine Learning Models: Build and compare models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for forecasting.
Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features (e.g., time-based, lag variables) to improve model performance.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost
Tools: Jupyter Notebook
